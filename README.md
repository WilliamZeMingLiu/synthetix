## Testing using LocalTerra

For testing purposes, follow the instructions on this [Github repo](https://github.com/terra-money/LocalTerra) to create a localterra blockchain.

## Connecting Wallet via Terra Station Browser Extension

If users want to view their account balance or send transactions, they must install the Terra Station browser extension in order to connect their wallet to the app.  The app will NEVER ask to store the user's private key due to security concerns.

The Terra Station browser extension [link can be found here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/terra-station/aiifbnbfobpmeekipheeijimdpnlpgpp?hl=en) (Google Chrome).
